After Installation you have to setup your customer groups to ENABLE for each payment method.

On the other hand products have the ability to DISABLE single payment methods.

Please remove old version of "cGroupPayments" and execute the following SQLstatement inside you database:
ALTER TABLE `customer_group` DROP `allowed_payment_methods`; to remove old table columns.

Thanks to Kiat Siong Ng (screenname kiatng) for the bugreport.

Thanks to Netzarbeiter Vinai Kopp and Medienagenten for Sponsorship of the preliminary module!";s:1:"r";a:1:{s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:10:"xlink:href";s:52:"/Chiara_PEAR_Server_REST/r/RicoNeitzel_PaymentFilter";}}}
