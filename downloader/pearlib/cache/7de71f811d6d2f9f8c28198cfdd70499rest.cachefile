Usefull to delete testing orders and clean your database.

Only orders without Invoice, Shippment or Creditmemo could be deleted.

Known Issues
****************
 - you don't see the "Delete" option in the Actions list? It is a conflict with others extensions which also rewrite the adminhtml/block/sales/order/grid.php. I should write soon a "how-to" to help you to solve this problem manually but there is no clean solution...

Roadmap
***********

- Add the possibility to delete an order with invoice, shippment, and creditmemo.

FAQ
*****
- Why can we delete only cancel order?
Because delete a complete order breaks links with invoices and shipments and could creates troubles.
